    "content": "**TL;DR:** Better choices come from pricing *all* costs (explicit + opportunity), thinking at the **margin**, and predicting how people respond to **incentives**.\n\n**Use this 1-minute checklist**\n- What's the *real* cost vs. benefit (include time and missed alternatives)?\n- How will incentives change behavior?\n- What changes at the **next** unit (time, money, output)?\n- What constraints bind (budget, capacity, time)?\n- Any ripple effects that move the new equilibrium?\n\n**Tiny example:** Buy a standing desk? If it saves 5 min/day of fatigue + context switching, that’s ~21 hrs/yr—often worth it."
